	<h1>Why digital portfolio is important?</h1>
	<p style="font-family:serif;font-size:20px;">Digital portfolio is also an easily accessible file to any students, teachers, workers, etc. With the digital version, anyone can express their creative minds how they want it to be and get the opportunity to play and experience with the technology world. They also have an ability to have access to it anywhere and easier to transfer to school or work.</p>
	<p style="font-family:serif;font-size:20px;"> Digital portfolio is a set of content document, works, presentations, and others with purpose to present works of an individual or a organization, in a digital form. With digital portfolio, I am able to present any works I have done and achieved before. I'm making this portfolio with the purpose to introduce myself, my goal in school, classes, and because this is a place for showing my creativity, I want to show works and projects I have done the past years and this year. Also this place allows me to explain my thinking, how I have improved myself, and how I handle the challenges I encountered.</p>
	<p style="font-family:serif;font-size:20px;"> With that being said, this could be used to introduce myself and display my works to everyone in the school, including teachers, and even for my applications in the future. It is to show the background of myself and what I have accomplished in high school years. It demonstrates my strength, experiences, and growth in any major I will decide to do in the future.</p>

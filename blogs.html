      <h2>Chegg</h2>
      <h3>May 15 2023</h3>
      <p>Chegg is an educational technology in America. It helps many students, especially college students, with homework and provides textbook rentals, tutoring, and other services for students. However, Chegg has been a way for students to cheat on their tests and homework. Students post a picture or screenshot of the problem to Chegg, which will give them the answer. Over time, Chegg has been very popular for years, but recently, their stocks dropped when students turned their interests to ChatGPT, an AI chatbot for multiple purposes; it gives you a human-like conversation but with a chatbot. Not only do students use this for their homework, but adults have been using it for the result, too. Chegg's stock dropped 48% Tuesday; even when it went up to 17%, it was still below Monday's closing price. Therefore, they decided to develop their own AI Product, ChegMate, which would be the same as ChatGPT.</p>

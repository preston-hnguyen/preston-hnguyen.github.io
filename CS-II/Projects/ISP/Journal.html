      <p><b>Technical Challenge:</b> I am still working on the outline and other parts of the website. However, I want to insert a picture, normally I would do it through Guacamole, but I am not longer have the permission to do that. I came up with the solution, I asked one of my teamate if they were able to upload a picture on VS code and from there they could push it to github (if they were able to) so I will be able to edit the website the way I want.</p>
      <p><b>Scheduling Challenge: </b> This week was extremely busy, I was not really able to work on the project except for class time in Computer Science.</p>
      <p><b>Interpersonal Challenge: </b> Our leader told me that I am done with my part, but I still want to edit and work on some parts of the project so it could look professional as possible.</p>

      <h3>20-Mar-2023</h3>
      <p><b>Technical Challenge:</b> I am still working the home page and other pages to make the website more professional; however, I am not able to upload a picture on tabby. I will probably going to seek help from Mr. Ben.</p>
      <p><b>Scheduling Challenge: </b> I had many tests, quizes, and essays to finish this week, so I only worked on the project during Computer Science period.</p>
      <p><b>Interpersonal Challenge: </b> None of us still has not figured out how to make the button to work; I will seek help from Mr. Ben.</p>

      <h3>13-Mar-2023</h3>
      <p><b>Technical Challenge:</b> I struggled with coding the home page of our project and got confused on why my code did not give the result it was supposed to give. Howver, I did more research on CSS and spent more time to read my code to spot the error. After, I succesfully finished the home page.</p>
      <p><b>Scheduling Challenge: </b> This week was not so busy, I spent most of the time working on the home page and try to make the code work.</p>
      <p><b>Interpersonal Challenge: </b> Our team is having a problem with the button and we do not know how to make it to work to get the resutl from the datas. None of us knows how to do it. We are still working on it to make it work.</p>

      <h3>27-Feb-2023</h3>
      <p><b>Technical Challenge:</b> I am still in the process of designing the website to look more professional. In order to do make it the way I want, I need to get more used to html and css, as well as doing more researh and learning to have a better understanding of the language. For example, making a button in a specific shape I want, I need to know how to make a shape and a button. Fortunately, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a> has the informations of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help our team on understanding the concept of the code. </p>
      <p><b>Scheduling Challenge: </b> This week has been busy. I have 2 retake tests in Physics, 2 other ones in Algebra 2, a major test grade in English, and the SAT on Wednesday. I do not have anytime to work on computer science and it has been really stressful.</p>
      <p><b>Interpersonal Challenge: </b>There is no conflicts nor challenged within the team. We now just need focus on the coding.</p>

      <h3>20-Feb-2023</h3>
      <p><b>Technical Challenge:</b> I wanted to make the website for professional and more appealing. Therefore, I decided to show the leader of the team and discuss with her about the new apperance and what it is going to look like.</p>
      <p><b>Scheduling Challenge: </b> Even though we had 2 days off, I still have to spend most of the time studying for the SAT on March 1st and retakes some of the tests, so I have not spent much time on the project.</p>
      <p><b>Interpersonal Challenge: </b>There is no conflicts nor challenged within the team. We now just need focus on the coding.</p>

      <h3>13-Feb-2023</h3>
      <p><b>Technical Challenge:</b> I was in charge of the mvp presentation in the team. I designed the whole presentation. However, I had to keep changing it so it meets all of the requirements. Fortunately, I had other team members to help, so I assigned each one of them with different tasks to fill in information on slides.</p>
      <p><b>Scheduling Challenge: </b> It was a busy week with different tests and quizses. However, I still manage to finish the presentation and perfect it.</p>
      <p><b>Interpersonal Challenge: </b>We had to keep deciding where we want to show our progress and what we have so far in making the website. So, I decided to make a temporary repository with the code we had so far and punlished it.</p>

      <h3>06-Feb-2023</h3>
      <p><b>Technical Challenge:</b> I am assigned to figure out how to make something work in Javascript, but with my little knowledge of coding, this is a challenge for me. I will have to get a lot of help and do a lot of research to help me accomplish this mission. Throughout this year, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a> is a helpful source for me to get help in coding.</p>
      <p><b>Scheduling Challenge: </b> I do not have many plans this week. Therefore, I could spend time to do more research and work on the project.</p>
      <p><b>Interpersonal Challenge: </b> So far there is no conflicts or any challenges within out teamates.</p>

      <h3>30-Jan-2023</h3>
      <p><b>Technical Challenge:</b> I had to make the presentation template for our ISP project. To make the presentation look good and more professional, I have to spend a lot of time look for a template on the internet and pick the one that would attract the audience's eyes. Fortunately, <a href="https://slidesgo.com/">Slidesgo</a> has different types of template for different categories that we can pick from, so I decided to use their template.</p>
      <p><b>Scheduling Challenge: </b> This week was not a busy week since we do not have school and everything to close due to the weather. I decided to spend a day working on the presentation and make it btter. I have completed my task to finish the presentation.</p>
      <p><b>Interpersonal Challenge: </b> Communication again is a challenge for me. One of our member does not a social media account to communicate, so everytime we discuss something, one of us has talk to her about it again. Sometimes it would get really frustrating to discuss without a member. Also, I finished the template for the presentation, but I need to talk to other members to work on which slide. </p>

      <h3>23-Jan-2023</h3>
      <p><b>Technical Challenge:</b> This week was not a busy week for me, I am getting my work done in the project and nothing has been in the progess much. However, I do not always have the access to the computer to work on the project. I always try to work on the project whenever I have the access to the computer.</p>
      <p><b>Scheduling Challenge: </b> I have so many tests this week, especially in APUSH and physics. I spent little time to work the project and spend most of the time studying for other classes to prepare for my tests.</p>
      <p><b>Interpersonal Challenge: </b> Communication has been a challenge for me. I somehow am not able to contact with other members in group chat through phone numbers. Therefore, we have to create a group chat on social media.</p>

      <h3>16-Jan-2023</h3>
      <p><b>Technical Challenge:</b> Over this week, I was looking for a place where software engineers in my team could start coding. It was pretty challenging for me, since I did not have any experience nor knowledge about any coding and technology related. I watched many videos and read many articles talking how source-code editors work and which one is good for consumers. However, it was a new experience for me, there were too many terminals and source-code editors that we could use, I had a hard time understanding how it works. So, I wrote down all the ones that are highly recommended and commonly used, which was a lot, it was pretty overwhelming. Then, I sorted out all of the ones I found and looked for the one that mets out requirements. Eventually, I chose one of the most famous source-code editors, Visual Studio Code.</p>
      <p><b>Scheduling Challenge: </b> I have arranged everything and set my priorities to finish my work. Using a planner helped me a lot in managing my time. Therefore, I was able to finish what I had to over this week.</p>
      <p><b>Interpersonal Challenge: </b> I have successfully finished my first task as a release engineer. I talked to the leader of my team(software engineer/project manager) to get all the infomations about what they need in the coding space, such as github, a terminal, and most important part is if we could see and publish the outcome of the product.</p>

      <h3>9-Jan-2023</h3>
      <p style = "font-size: 20px;"><b>Technical Challenge: </b>One challenge I am facing is needing help while working on the project and the assignment assigned to us this week. I need to learn how to do the whole GitHub process we are supposed to finish this week. I will seek help from my colleagues or the teacher on what we need to do and how to work on GitHub.</p>
      <p style = "font-size: 20px;"><b>Scheduling Challenge: </b> During the second week of the 2nd semester, I have been extremely busy with two specific classes: AP Physics and English. I need help to control and manage my time wisely to fit it into my daily schedule appropriately so that I can do my other work from other classes like Computer Science and AP US History. Having too many advanced courses with tons of assignments is difficult for me to set priorities. However, I am making a proper schedule and plan to make my studying efficient and ensure everything is done on time.</p>
      <p style = "font-size: 20px;"><b>Interpersonal Challenge: </b> Another issue I am facing right now is completing my role as a release engineer. Before, I was afraid of this role and that I will not be able to complete it. I talked to my colleague if I could change my role to become a project manager or product manager. However, I cannot change my role, but after talking to them, I feel more confident and at ease. Therefore, I will continue to work as hard as possible to complete all the tasks that I am assigned.</p>
    </div>

      <h3>2-Jan-2023</h3>
      <p style = "font-size: 20px;">I have been assigned to be a release engineer. However, throughout the year, it has been hard for me to manage my time wisely and keeping up with my other classes. Therefore, I have many challenges to overcome to be better prepared for the outcome of the product in May and also to not affect other team members.</p>
      <p style = "font-size: 20px;"> The biggest challenge I am facing right now is the changing of priorities. The concepts, requirements, and the amount of tasks would keep changing, so this could lead abandoned tasks and redoing tasks. To get it under control, I will discuss all the tasks with my team members to list all tasks we need to do for the project and complete the most important tasks first. For that reason, I also a problem in time mananging. Besides this class, I must spend much time to finish other works in other classes, especially history and physics. Also, during this year, I have been procastinating a lot. To be able to get better in controlling my time better, I will have to stop procastinating and focus on school work more, that is why I have deleted my social media, and I have an app to keep track of my time to do homework and other chores more effectively. Another problem I encountered was meeting and communicating with my colleagues. I have not gotten enough time to meet any of my colleagues or to any meetings that they probably had. However, the leader of the team updated me everything and what I needed to work on, so that I could overcome the problem.</p>
      <p style = "font-size: 20px;">For this project, we will have five total roles in the team, software engineer, QA engineer, project manager, product manager, and release engineer. With software engineering, I will need more than my experience and skills to complete the tasks perfectly and the project. I will face many challenges with coding parts because I need to gain basic coding knowledge. As a QA engineer, besides coding, I could ensure the product meets the requirements or standards to satisfy the users and record all test cases in detail. However, I would have a problem fixing the code if there were any bugs, but to overcome this problem, I would need another team member to share tasks with, so we could check the code and debug it together. As a release engineer in the team, I put code under version control applications like GitHub. I am also responsible for code branching and merging. With this job, I will face many challenges, such as learning about code branches and merging more, but I would do more research to help me complete the job.</p>
      <p style = "font-size: 20px;">Despite my coding skills, I could be good at managing and completing specific tasks during the process. As the project manager, I am capable of planning the project effectively, ensuring all tasks are completed and defining what “perfection” looks like, managing what resources team members will use on the project, and making sure it is appropriate to use on the project. I could also document every process of the project and analyze it. At the same time, I would still make mistakes in checking on the entire project, so I would need the leader to review everything with me to ensure it is perfect. I could also be good at managing the product, like making sure the product is appropriate and meets all the requirements to make sure it is good enough for the users, and I could help my colleagues to manage their time. Though I struggle with solving problems to create product ideas, I would try to understand the situation clearly and focus on a solution.

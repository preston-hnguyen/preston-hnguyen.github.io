      <p><b>Technical Challenge:</b> This week was not a busy week for me, I am getting my work done in the project and nothing has been in the progess much. However, I do not always have the access to the computer to work on the project. I always try to work on the project whenever I have the access to the computer.</p>
      <p><b>Scheduling Challenge: </b> I have so many tests this week, especially in APUSH and physics. I spent little time to work the project and spend most of the time studying for other classes to prepare for my tests.</p>
      <p><b>Interpersonal Challenge: </b> Communication has been a big challenge for me. I somehow am not able to contact with other members in group chat through phone numbers. Therefore, we have to create a group chat on social media.<p>

      <h3>16-Jan-2023</h3>
      <p><b>Technical Challenge:</b> Over this week, I was looking for a place where software engineers in my team could start coding. It was pretty challenging for me, since I did not have any experience nor knowledge about any coding and technology related. I watched many videos and read many articles talking how source-code editors work and which one is good for consumers. However, it was a new experience for me, there were too many terminals and source-code editors that we could use, I had a hard time understanding how it works. So, I wrote down all the ones that are highly recommended and commonly used, which was a lot, it was pretty overwhelming. Then, I sorted out all of the ones I found and looked for the one that mets out requirements. Eventually, I chose one of the most famous source-code editors, Visual Studio Code.</p>
      <p><b>Scheduling Challenge: </b> I have arranged everything and set my priorities to finish my work. Using a planner helped me a lot in managing my time. Therefore, I was able to finish what I had to over this week.</p>
      <p><b>Interpersonal Challenge: </b> I have successfully finished my first task as a release engineer. I talked to the leader of my team(software engineer/project manager) to get all the infomations about what they need in the coding space, such as github, a terminal, and most important part is if we could see and publish the outcome of the product.</p>

      <h3>9-Jan-2023</h3>
      <p style = "font-size: 20px;"><b>Technical Challenge: </b>One challenge I am facing is needing help while working on the project and the assignment assigned to us this week. I need to learn how to do the whole GitHub process we are supposed to finish this week. I will seek help from my colleagues or the teacher on what we need to do and how to work on GitHub.</p>
      <p style = "font-size: 20px;"><b>Scheduling Challenge: </b> During the second week of the 2nd semester, I have been extremely busy with two specific classes: AP Physics and English. I need help to control and manage my time wisely to fit it into my daily schedule appropriately so that I can do my other work from other classes like Computer Science and AP US History. Having too many advanced courses with tons of assignments is difficult for me to set priorities. However, I am making a proper schedule and plan to make my studying efficient and ensure everything is done on time.</p>
      <p style = "font-size: 20px;"><b>Interpersonal Challenge: </b> Another issue I am facing right now is completing my role as a release engineer. Before, I was afraid of this role and that I will not be able to complete it. I talked to my colleague if I could change my role to become a project manager or product manager. However, I cannot change my role, but after talking to them, I feel more confident and at ease. Therefore, I will continue to work as hard as possible to complete all the tasks that I am assigned.</p>

      <h3>2-Jan-2023</h3>
      <p style = "font-size: 20px;">I have been assigned to be a release engineer. However, throughout the year, it has been hard for me to manage my time wisely and keeping up with my other classes. Therefore, I have many challenges to overcome to be better prepared for the outcome of the product in May and also to not affect other team members.</p>
      <p style = "font-size: 20px;"> The biggest challenge I am facing right now is the changing of priorities. The concepts, requirements, and the amount of tasks would keep changing, so this could lead abandoned tasks and redoing tasks. To get it under control, I will discuss all the tasks with my team members to list all tasks we need to do for the project and complete the most important tasks first. For that reason, I also a problem in time mananging. Besides this class, I must spend much time to finish other works in other classes, especially history and physics. Also, during this year, I have been procastinating a lot. To be able to get better in controlling my time better, I will have to stop procastinating and focus on school work more, that is why I have deleted my social media, and I have an app to keep track of my time to do homework and other chores more effectively. Another problem I encountered was meeting and communicating with my colleagues. I have not gotten enough time to meet any of my colleagues or to any meetings that they probably had. However, the leader of the team updated me everything and what I needed to work on, so that I could overcome the problem.</p>
      <p style = "font-size: 20px;">For this project, we will have five total roles in the team, software engineer, QA engineer, project manager, product manager, and release engineer. With software engineering, I will need more than my experience and skills to complete the tasks perfectly and the project. I will face many challenges with coding parts because I need to gain basic coding knowledge. As a QA engineer, besides coding, I could ensure the product meets the requirements or standards to satisfy the users and record all test cases in detail. However, I would have a problem fixing the code if there were any bugs, but to overcome this problem, I would need another team member to share tasks with, so we could check the code and debug it together. As a release engineer in the team, I put code under version control applications like GitHub. I am also responsible for code branching and merging. With this job, I will face many challenges, such as learning about code branches and merging more, but I would do more research to help me complete the job.</p>
      <p style = "font-size: 20px;">Despite my coding skills, I could be good at managing and completing specific tasks during the process. As the project manager, I am capable of planning the project effectively, ensuring all tasks are completed and defining what “perfection” looks like, managing what resources team members will use on the project, and making sure it is appropriate to use on the project. I could also document every process of the project and analyze it. At the same time, I would still make mistakes in checking on the entire project, so I would need the leader to review everything with me to ensure it is perfect. I could also be good at managing the product, like making sure the product is appropriate and meets all the requirements to make sure it is good enough for the users, and I could help my colleagues to manage their time. Though I struggle with solving problems to create product ideas, I would try to understand the situation clearly and focus on a solution.

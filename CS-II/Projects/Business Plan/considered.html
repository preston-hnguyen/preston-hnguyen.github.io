      <p>This is an interesting project. This will help students to organize their works and what they need to focus on first. Many students would get lost and would not what to start when they do their homeworks. This ISP would help them to manage their time efficiently. However, I am still rejecting this project, because nowadays, there are many popular app and websites to help students to manage their time and can be used as a reminder for anything.</p>

      <p>This project is a good way to manage spendings and money. Many people keeping spending tons of money on things they do not need and throw them away when they get bored of it. Saving money is necessary and this project would efficiently help everyone to save money. Yet, I am rejecting this project, because how could you create something to make someone not to spend their money, it is their will to not spend money and you cannot change that or even help that.</p>

      <p>This is a really creative idea to keep someone awake. I like the idea of alarm would go off based on a person's facial expression. Many people want to stay awake to get their works done. However, I am rejectign this idea, because everyone needs a break, they also should not have that much works at once, unless they wait until the last minute to do it. Pushing yourself to do something would affect your physical and mental health.</p>

      <p>This is a nice idea. Lunch lines at Allen High are normally really long and overwhelming. Sometimes people could be in a rush and need to get good fast. This would help the lunch move faster, since students could order their food on phones or any devices. However, this idea could be a little unecessary, because there have been no problems at all with the lunch lines, and making orders online could be more overwhelming, because sometimes, students could make a lots of orders and there might to no space to place their ordersa and students could pick up the wrong order.</p>

      <p>This would be a nice way to look for an event you want to attend to. Sometimes people need to get out of their house because they just do not have anything to do. With this project, they will be able to see and know what is happening around them. However, I am rejecting this ISP, because there are many apps and websites to look for what is happening around them already.</p>

      <p>This is nice to help students to look for their busses. Many studnts are still taking the bus. This would help students to locate where their bus is and when it is gonna arrive. However, there is already a website for tracking buses, and how are you gonna have the bus routes information?</p>
      <p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/azmer-ali/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan</a></p>
      <p>This is good for people with anxiety. When you make a reservation at a restaurant, normally you would talk to them. However this help people to make a reservation through some presses on the phone. However, this is unnecessary, restaurants mostly would have their own way to make a reservation on their website.</p>

      <p>This would help the students to be more save. Strangers could walk in the school any time and do dangerous things that could harm the students, so this would prevent that. However, I am rejecting this because many security guards would lose their jobs and some people need to make a living. Also, scanning would take a long time and students would line up, so it would become overwhelming.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/hamza-ebeida/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan</a></p>
      <p>This is an easy and faster way to take attendance. Sometimes, attendance would take away some time in class. However, this could lead to skipping, because they could ask their friend to scan their ID for them.</p>

      <p>I would love to be working on this project, because this is actually helping people to understand and know what is going on when they notice something with their body. Sometimes, it would be hard for someone to know what happened to their body and what kind of sickness or even disorder they have. </p>

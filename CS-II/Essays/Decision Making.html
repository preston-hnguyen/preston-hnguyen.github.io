    <h2>Bias Issue in Making Decisions</h2>

    <p>As a team with different ways of thinking and ideas, we would like to run into diverse problems to make a decision. This essay will explain different biases our group would run into, causing disfavor or unfair behaviors. It would include personal bias and biases that would take place in the whole group.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align:left;">Confirmation Bias</h2> 
    <p>This bias only takes information that positively supports one's ideas or beliefs. To cooperate with other team members, each of us will have different opinions about the project and how to work together to complete the project perfectly. However, it could lead to a contrast in ideas and conflicts between the member. We tend only to believe what we think is right and not listen to others' opinions. It has been a common issue among any group to improve the project. To overcome this problem, each member should be open-minded to every member's opinions on what to do.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align:left;">Cosmetic Bias</h2> 
    <p>With different opinions and pieces of information from different team members, there will be a problem with what information we would take to provide in the presentation of the product. In a group, it would be a need to select and omit one's opinions. Still, this is a way to disrespect a person. Instead, we could cooperate their opinion with others; that way, the product could provide users with more information and be more effective.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align:left;">Anchoring Bias</h2> 
    <p>Anchoring bias is also known as "first impression bias." When we get the information that would be helpful to provide evidence for a topic, we tend to get stuck on one particular piece of information and rely heavily on it. As we keep working on a plan, we would keep getting new information; however, we would commonly object to it if it contracts the first information we got. Instead of having a broader view, we use the "first-time impression" as the anchor to extend into different ideas. As a team, we should work together, and with multiple brains, we should also consider different viewpoints and think deeply about them and the first information we get.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align:left;">Overconfidence Bias</h2> 
    <p>It is an issue of one's individual, not the whole team; it is one's opinion that they think is better than others. It happens when someone thinks their intelligence is better than others, even when the opinion is wrong, causing others to take risks and follow the wrong direction. To control it, each of us should consider and ask ourselves questions to look into a more oversized frame, such as how did I come up with this idea? Are there any logical reasons to support my claim? Is it based on facts? How is it compare to other opinions?</p>
    <h2 style="text-align:left;">Progress Bias</h2> 
    <p>When we only look at the positive progress, we make and overstate it and downplay the negative actions. We only like and focus on the positive actions we have made; on the other hand, we neglect the negative actions and ignore them. We only look at what is positive and continue doing bad things, but we are more on the positive side than we are. To help that, we should take feedback from others outside the group to comment on what should be improved and not just our opinions, and we must be down to different ideas and a bigger picture.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align:left;">Conclusion</h2> 
    <p>In the end, these biases commonly show how we only favor the positive side and not look at the negative side of the situation. As a group, we must together fix and help each other with problems in decision-making, so that we can improve the project to become better. </p>

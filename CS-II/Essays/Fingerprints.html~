    <p>“HTTPS” stands for Hypertext transfer protocol secure, used by many web sites nowadays and the number will keep increasing, it provides privacy and protection for their users. Using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security), it is able to encrypt communications, the special thing is no on knows how to break it. Privacy data sent is back and forth over HTTPS/SSL/TLS to improve and is more secured. However, this upsets many private institutions, because they have lost the access to every details of their users.</p>
    <p>Coming from the traditional “HTTP”, the “S” was added to back means “Secure”, or at least what it was supposed to do. HTTPS Proxy Appliance circumvent our basic assumption and guarantee of Internet browser privacy and security, mostly used by schools, businesses, and others. They could look over and regulate users’ activities when it is under their control. This could be dangerous, since important informations are not completely private and could be accessed.</p>
    <p>There is also a hacking technique hack called man-in-the-middle-attack, aka MITM. When two computer are exchanging encrypted to decode a message. MITM is in between the conversation to eavesdrop or impersonate one of the parties. They steal personal information, such as login information, addressed, credit cards, etc. Which could potentially lead to identity thief.</p>
    <p>But to improve this privacy, an entity called certificate authority (aka CA). They are to prove identity of entities(websites, emails, companies, etc.) in real physical world. They make internet more secured for organizations and users and prevents frauds. It verifies that site by signing site’s security certificate. But it could be disturbed with  SSL interpretation.</p>
    <p>A hash is a complicated mathematical algorithms, it processes every single bit of the information, if one bit of the certificate changes, the whole hash is gonna change completely. To be a good hash, the value is determined by the data, the function includes all input data, distributes data across the hash values, and different hash values for similar strings.</p>
    <p>However, this SSL interception cannot be prevented but can be delated. It will be detected When the server’s secret private cryptographic key is not publicly shown. When hackers try to decrypt keys, they are forced to have a different public keys.</p>
    <p>Also, a False-positive is incorrect alert, it shows the danger is present when it is not, technically a false alarm. False-negative is the opposite, it is a false alarm, but the danger is present when it does not show the presence of error.</p>
